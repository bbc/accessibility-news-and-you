title: Accessibility and Testing with Jaws
---

Jaws is a screen reader for **PC** desktop devices. 

Jaws should be tested with **Chrome**. Test using an actual device if possible.

## What should I test?
0. Test the feature by reading every element.
1. Test the feature by reading headers.
2. Test the feature by tabbing through links.
1. Test the feature by reading landmarks.
2. Test the feature for use of ARIA.

## Testing steps

The accessibility acceptance criteria can be used for additional manual testing steps on device, this is written by the [Business Analyst](accessibility-news-and-business-analysts) and part of their checklist.

### General

0. Open **Chrome**.
1. Go to the **testing url**.
2. **Turn Jaws on**. 
3. Navigate to the last element in the feature before the feature to be tested, this will ensure you don't miss any visually hidden/off screen text at the beginning of the feature. Then use 'Down arrow' to read **through each element** in the feature (if you need to go back, 'Up arrow'). 
- Is all the content read out and make sense? 
- Is the content read out in a logical order following the visual order? 
- Is any content read out more than once?
- Is any visually hidden/off screen text read out, such as for icons?
- Do images have alt text?
- Are there any empty key presses? e.g. You press the keys and you don't hear anything. If so, this maybe a bug.
4. Navigate to the last element in the feature before the feature to be tested, then use 'H' to read **through each heading** in the feature (if you need to go back, 'H + SHIFT'). 
- Are all headings read out and in a logical order? 
- Not sure what headings the feature should read out? You can use a desktop browser tool such as the [Web Developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm) add-on for Chrome or Firefox. (Under ‘Information’ select ‘View Document Outline’ - This will show you the heading structure for the selected page.) 
5. Navigate to the end of the feature before the feature to be tested, then use the 'TAB' key to read out all '**Links**' in the feature (if you need to go back, 'TAB + SHIFT').
- Are all links read out? 
- Is any content that is not a link read out?
6. Navigate to the end of the feature before the feature to be tested, then use 'R' to read through all '**Landmarks**', in the feature (if you need to go back, 'R + SHIFT').
- Are all landmarks read out? 
- Not sure what landmarks are? See [W3C ARIA Landmarks Examples](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html). Not sure what landmarks the feature should read out? See the accessibility acceptance criteria.
7. **ARIA** can be used simply to add landmarks/regions/labels to a page or more advanced usage can help with dynmaic content such as page updates or advanced user interface controls such as tabs. Use 'Down arrow' to move through the feature checking that all ARIA is being acknowledge/read out correctly. See the accessibility acceptance criteria for details on what should be read out. Still not sure what should be acknowledged/read out? Ask an Accessiblity Champion.

### Tables

0. Open **Chrome**.
1. Go to the **testing url**.
2. **Turn Jaws on**. 
3. Navigate to the last visible element before the table to be tested, this will ensure you don't miss any visually hidden/off screen text at the beginning of the table. Then use all the [table keyboard shortcuts](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/jaws-keyboard-shortcuts#id384_tables) (with exception to those that use the num pad keys if using a laptop), to go **through each element** in the table.
- Are table row and column headers read out for each table cell?
- Is all the content read out and make sense? 
- Is the content read out in a logical order following the visual order? 
- Is any content read out more than once?
- Is any visually hidden/off screen text read out, such as for icons?
- Are there any empty key presses? e.g. You press the keys and you don't hear anything. If so, this maybe a bug.
4. Read **through table headers** by pressing 'T' (if you need to go back, 'T + SHIFT').
- Do all tables have a unique caption? Captions help users to find a table and understand what it’s about. e.g. When you navigate to a table using 'T' or 'T + SHIFT', is a heading announced for the table which helps users understand what the table is about?

## Shortcut keys

0. **Move forwards through every page element**: 'Down arrow'
1. **Move backwards through every page element**: 'Up arrow'
2. Navigate **forwards through headings**: 'H'
3. Navigate **backwards through headings**: 'H + SHIFT'
4. Navigate **forwards through heading levels**: '1 - 6'
5. Navigate **backwards through heading levels**: '1 - 6 + SHIFT'
6. Navigate **forwards through links**: 'TAB'
7. Navigate **backwards through links**: 'TAB + SHIFT'
8. To **activate a link**: 'Enter'
8. To **activate a button**: 'Enter or Space bar'
9. Navigate **forwards through landmarks**: 'R'
10. Navigate **backwards through landmarks**: 'R + SHIFT'
11. **Stop Jaws talking**: 'CTRL'

### Document presentation mode 

JAWS has two modes for displaying webpages using the virtual cursor, Simple Layout and Screen Layout. Simple Layout is the default, which displays content in a linear fashion - putting each link or control on its own line. Screen Layout formats content in a similar way to how it’s displayed on screen. For example an inline list in Screen Layout mode could be read out all in one go. In Simple Layout mode, each list item will be placed on it's own line and be read individually. Screen Layout mode can be useful for reading tables.

#### Switching between modes
- In Internet Explorer: 'INSERT + V'.
- Type: 'Document Presentation' to find the setting.
- Change the mode in the 'Document Presentation Mode' dropdown menu.
- Press: 'OK'.

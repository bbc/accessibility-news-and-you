            <p>User experience designers are responsible for designing the user experience. Period. A visual is not enough. This doesn't ensure a good user experience (UX) for all users. Accessible design process includes documenting the non-visual UX, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a> users. This also helps in achieving a good user experience for other types of assistive technology users.</p>

            <p>This guide aims to demystify an area that can often be seen as daunting. If you don’t know where to start or maybe weren’t aware that this was your responsibility, then this guide will introduce you to concepts of screen reader UX and how to document this for your component. It’s actually fairly straight forward, and just an extra step to your process. It’s ok to concentrate on the visual user experience first, you’ve got to start somewhere, though always try to keep the screen reader UX in mind.</p>

            <p>This guide won’t necessarily teach you how to make your user experience accessible or what best practice might be for your component. This is where accessibility guidelines come into play; such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/mobile/">BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines</a> for web and native apps, along with platform specific guides like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/">iOS Human Interface Accessibility Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/">Android Accessibility Guide</a> or the <a href="https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html">Material Design Accessibility Guidelines</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG</a> is also a valuable resource, even though web specific many of the same principles apply. Consult guidelines as part of your process. And also consider other types of assistive technology users.</p>

            <p>Thinking about everything at once can be overwhelming. Let’s focus on the screen reader UX. Using your visual as a starting point, this guide takes you step by step through how to document this for native app based content. For web based content see the <a href="screen-reader-ux.html">web guide</a>.</p>

            <p>Like a visual, you might not get this right the first time, doing this with pencil and paper will save you time. You can then document the results in a digital format afterwards.</p>

            <p>So lets start! Grab a pencil or pen if you prefer&hellip; Then do one of the following:</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">

            <div class="back-to-container">
                <a href="#steps" class="back-to">Back to steps</a>
            </div>

            <h3 id="step-2-cross-out-elements-you-dont-need" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 2 - Cross out elements you don’t need</h3>

            <p>Are there any elements in the visual user experience that you don’t need in the screen reader UX? For example, an element that might not be relevant or make sense, or an element that doesn't add anything to the user experience, for a screen reader user.</p>

            <p>Best practice would almost always be to have the same elements for all users. Though sometimes there may be an exception, as user needs in the visual and non-visual UX can vary, the UX should be comparable. Before crossing out an element, question why one user group would have an element and not another. Also keep in mind that you will be hiding this content from other assistive technology, such as speech recognition and reading solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Cross out elements you don't need and label them as hidden elements</strong>. They will still form part of the visual user experience. In our example ‘Share’ component, the input field element containing the url of the link is for illustrative purposes, so we’ll cross this out.</p>

            <details class="details">
                <summary>Other examples of elements you might not need</summary>
                
                <h4 class="details_h4">Images</h4>
                    
                <p>Is there an decorative or presentational image which doesn’t need alternative text (alt text)? Or an image that would repeat associated text content? For example, in the case of an article byline the portrait photo might not need alt text if it would repeat the text next to it e.g. the name of the author.</p>

                <img src="/accessibility-news-and-you/assets/img/screen-reader-ux/byline.png" alt="Sketch of article byline with portrait photo crossed out" class="image_byline" width="600">

                <h4 class="details_h4">Alternatives</h4>

                <p>Is there any content that you are providing an alternative for? Such as an interactive map that can't be accessible.</p>
            </details>

            <img src="/accessibility-news-and-you/assets/img/screen-reader-ux/step-2.png" alt="Step 2, sketch with elements that we don't need crossed out" class="sketch" width="600">

            <div class="back-to-container">
                <a href="#steps" class="back-to">Back to steps</a>
            </div>

            <h3 id="step-3-add-any-extra-elements" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 3 - Add any extra elements</h3>
        
            <p>Would any additional elements improve the user experience for screen reader users? Any such elements will be rarely needed and should be used sparingly.</p>

            <p>Like the previous step, best practice would almost always be to have the same elements for all users. Before adding an extra element, question why one user group would have an element and not another. Also keep in mind that it's easy to forget extra elements are there, as you can’t see them, in a future iteration these elements could be forgotten about and no longer make sense.</p>

            <p><strong>Draw on any extra elements, and label them as visually hidden elements</strong>, as we don’t want to add them to the visual user experience. In our example, we’ll add a heading element so screen reader users can easily identify and find this content. Don’t forget to consider the context of the component at the screen level. A heading element may not be appropriate for all ‘Share’ components.</p>

            <img src="/accessibility-news-and-you/assets/img/screen-reader-ux/step-3.png" alt="Step 3, sketch with extra elements added" class="sketch" width="600">

            <div class="back-to-container">
                <a href="#steps" class="back-to">Back to steps</a>
            </div>

            <h3 id="step-4-define-the-content-order" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 4 - Define the content order</h3>

            <p>In what order should a screen reader read through the elements? To illustrate this, <strong>add a number next to each element</strong>. Always try to make the order of elements match the visual order. A mismatch could lead to confusion for some users, such as a sighted screen reader user. It will also make building the component more complex.</p>

            <p>On occasion, there may be times when the desired visual order just can’t give a good experience for a screen reader user. In our example, the ‘X’ close button is visually displayed on the top right as is best practise. It may not provide the best screen reader UX to have this content announced before the other share options. So on this occasion we'll change the content order for screen reader users.</p>

            <p>Another example is information that is key to an interaction. In our example, the text “Warning: Not responsible for content on social platforms” is such a case. Inorder for a screen reader user to make an informed decision, this information should be read before the share buttons. Ideally this warning text should be displayed before the buttons in the visual too, as this would help other users as well.</p>

            <img src="/accessibility-news-and-you/assets/img/screen-reader-ux/step-4.png" alt="Step 4, sketch with numbers added next to each element to define the content order" class="sketch" width="600">

            <div class="back-to-container">
                <a href="#steps" class="back-to">Back to steps</a>
            </div>

            <h3 id="step-5-define-native-semantic-roles" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 5 - Define native semantic roles</h3>

            <p>In a well designed visual user experience, a sighted user should be able to identify elements and their semantic roles along with any expected behaviours by simply looking at them. For example, when viewing an article, you can usually identify text that has a semantic role of heading because the font size of it is larger than that of surrounding text. For screen reader users you need to convey this in another way, by using meaningful code. This is often referred to as semantic code.</p>

            <p>Semantic code defines the roles of elements and relationships between elements, which then conveys the meaning and structure of content to screen reader users. This is usually conveyed to the user alongside <a href="#step-6-define-the-announced-content">the announced content</a> of elements. This also tells the screen reader how elements behave or should be treated.<p>

            <p>Some platforms have a wider range of semantic roles that you can natively apply than others. For web content there are a vast array of semantic roles that you can natively apply compared to a native app. And an iOS app currently has a greater array of semantic roles natively available, to that of an Android app.</p>

            <p>Depending on the platform semantics are defined in the code via different methods. However, the outcome will always be the same. An element with a role of button will always be a button. You don’t need to know how to write the code, however some basic knowledge will be an advantage.</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><strong>HTML</strong> primarily defines semantic roles of elements and structure of web content.</li>
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Traits</strong> primarily define semantic roles of elements and structure of iOS app content.</li>
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Roles</strong> primarily define semantic roles of elements and structure of Android app content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Think about every element in your component and the associated semantic roles for the non-visual user experience. Consider what role is the most appropriate to convey the meaning you had intended from the visual styling. Strip away the presentation styling and what are you left with? A heading, an image, a button etc.</p>

            <p><strong>Define native semantic roles for relevant elements along with any platform specifics. If appropriate also document any <a href="#heading-levels">heading levels</a> for elements with a role of heading.</strong> Standard <a href="#ui-elements">UI elements</a> usually come with default roles that define semantics, it is however always still important to document. In our example, we’ll define native semantic roles of heading, button and link. The role of link isn’t available for Android, so we’ll document an alternative.</p>

            <details class="details">
                <summary>Which native semantic roles are the most appropriate for app content</summary>

                <p>Native semantic roles are limited for native apps compared to that of HTML, and therefore the UX is simpler. Elements can have more than one role as per HTML, though if there isn’t an appropriate native role, don’t define anything. No semantics will be announced with this content. Not sure which roles to define? Collaborate with an engineer. You will usually only need to use a handful of native roles from the following.</p>

                <p>Headings aid a screen reader user’s understanding of the information hierarchy of screens. Native apps generally have a simpler UX than that of web content, and therefore a simpler heading structure with headings that provide no context or level. Though as per HTML, for iOS it is possible to specify <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/key/2865779-accessibilitytextheadinglevel">heading levels</a> (from 1 - 6) for headings. This decision should take into account the overall screen heading structure used throughout your app. Always use a consistent approach. Think carefully about whether you want to do this and always discuss this with an engineer.</p>

                <p>Also take into account platform specifics:</p>

                <ul class="body-copy-list" role="list">
                    <li role="listitem"><strong>Navigation</strong> - Both VoiceOver on iOS and Talkback on Android give users the ability to navigate via headings. Though they do not give users the ability to navigate via heading level like a desktop screen reader does for web content.</li>

                    <li role="listitem"><strong>Android</strong> - The Android platform does not currently provide a way to natively code heading levels.</li>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Lists and tables</h4>

                <p>Native semantic roles are limited for iOS and Android apps, compared to that of the web. Some common semantic roles that you might have expected to see listed here, such as those for lists and tables cannot be defined via native roles, for native app content, as they can be via HTML for web content. Unless predefined as part of a standard UI element. Any additional desired semantic roles should be documented under <a href="#step-7-add-any-ux-improvements">UX improvements</a>. Always consider carefully if any such semantics are appropriate for app content.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Link vs button</h4>

                <p>It’s important to use the correct semantic role for the job. Links and buttons have different behaviours which have well established user expectations. Such as being able to activate a button by pressing the spacebar on a keyboard. Use a button for in-app interactions, for both in-page interactions and those between screens. Use a link if you will be taken out of the app to web content upon activation. Note link semantics aren’t available for native Android apps, in this case use a button.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Perceived affordance</h4>

                <p>Semantic roles communicate the meaning of content to screen reader users. They also communicate expectations. For example when an element is interacted with, such as link vs button. Expectations aren't only important for screen reader users. Visual styling gives sighted users an expectation and a perceived affordance. Visual styling should communicate the semantic meaning of elements. For example, interactive elements should look like interactive elements. If you don't have perceived affordance this may cause issues for some users. For example, those using speech recognition assistive technology, such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210417">VoiceControl</a> on iOS, rely on being able to visually interpret meaning and behaviour to know what they can interact with and how, via speech.</p>

                <summary id="ui-elements">UI elements</summary>

                <p>Web content is built with HTML elements. In native apps the content is built with UI elements, these might also be referred to as UI components or UI building blocks, or specifically on Android also as UI widgets. We’ll refer to them collectively as UI elements here. Semantic roles are then applied to UI elements to give them meaning. Standard UI elements usually come with predefined semantic roles out of the box. Custom UI elements however, do not come with any predefined semantic roles.

            <h3 id="step-6-define-the-announced-content" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 6 - Define the announced content</h3>
        
            <p>When a screen reader encounters an element with a semantic role, meaning is usually conveyed. The screen reader will also announce the content of the element. For example, when a screen reader encounters an element with a semantic role of heading and content of ‘Screen reader UX’. The combined announcement of semantic role and content would result in ‘heading, Screen reader UX’ or ‘Screen reader UX, heading’ depending on the screen reader. Like web browsers, screen readers can behave slightly differently.</p>

            <p>For a comparable experience to that of the visual, you should document the content or text that should be announced for each element. This should include images and icons, in such cases this is often referred to as a textual alternative or alternative text. You have already documented semantics by defining native semantic roles.</p>

            <p>You might want to announce extra text content to that of the visual. For example, to provide context, which might be obvious or not relevant in the visual user experience. Extra text won't form part of the visual user experience. An engineer can decide what is the most appropriate way to implement this, usually via an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel">accessibility label for iOS</a> or the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:contentDescription">content description for Android</a>. Use extra text sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>Document what content should be announced for each element</strong>. In our example, in addition to the text in the visual, we’ll also document extra text for the 'More' button to provide context. Along with the announced content for icons and images.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Context</h4>

                <p>In our example, there’s a button with text of ‘More’. We could just announce this content. However, a screen reader user may need extra information to be sure what they’re going to be shown more of. So we’ll provide some by announcing ‘More share options’. This is especially useful when elements are navigated to out of context. Ideally you should also visually display this text, as this would be useful for everyone.</p>

                <p>Another approach could be to provide context via a <a href="#hints">hint</a>. This would result in a combined announcement of content, semantic role, and hint of ‘More. Button. More share options’. This isn’t the preferred UX in this case, as we can further improve the UX of the button by providing an affordance for the <a href="#states">state</a> of the button. Providing context via a hint in addition to announcing state (such as ‘More. Button. More share options. Expanded’) could result in an overly verbose and unclear UX.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Icons</h4>

                <p>If an icon is key to understanding, it will need some text content announcing for it, that communicates its meaning and purpose. This is referred to as a textual alternative. For example, if an icon, such as a video play button, doesn’t have any associated text that conveys its meaning and purpose, a textual alternative would be needed for a screen reader user. In our example, the ‘X’ close button would be such a case. We could just announce ‘Close’, though this doesn’t give any context. Context could be provided by announcing ‘Close more share options’. However, the preferred UX in this case is to provide context later via a <a href="#hints">hint</a>. This will result in the semantic role being announced before the context which will aid browsing of content. Such as ‘Close. Button. Close more share options’.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Images</h4>

                <p>The announced content for an image is referred to as alternative text or text alternative. This should describe the image.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Key information</h4>

                <p>Try to provide key information first for text alternatives. This will aid browsing of content so users don't have to always listen to the full text. In our example, the function of button elements 3 to 6 is to share an article. To uniquely describe the target of each button, we also need to announce the social platform. The social platform distinguishes this from the other share buttons so we'll announce that first. We can then announce the function or context afterwards. For example 'Facebook, share this article'. Though the preferred UX in this case is to provide context later via a <a href="#hints">hint</a>. This will result in the semantic role being announced before the context, aiding browsing further. Such as ‘Facebook. Button. Share this article’.</p>

                <p>Abbreviations which are commonly known and spoken do not need unabbreviated announced content. For example GMT is an abbreviation for Greenwich Mean Time. The abbreviation of this is commonly spoken.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Commonly known but not spoken</h4>

                <p>Abbreviations which are commonly known but not usually spoken, should have unabbreviated announced content. Or preferably be unabbreviated as this would be helpful for other users as well, such as those with a learning impairment. For example the date ‘Thursday 18th December’ is commonly abbreviated to ‘Thur 18th Dec’. Though you would not say ‘Thur’ or ‘Dec’ even if it was written like that. Another example would be an abbreviated timestamp of ‘1h’, this is an abbreviation for ‘1 hour ago’. Providing both abbreviated and unabbreviated content is also a less than optimal code solution.</p>

                <h4 class="details_h4">Not commonly known</h4>

                <p>Abbreviations which are not commonly known should have unabbreviated announced content. Or preferably be unabbreviated as this would be helpful for all users.</p>

            <p>Improvements should be called upon sparingly. They are particularly relevant for in-screen interactions and dynamic content. In our example, the 'More' button has a downwards arrow icon. This is a visual clue for sighted users. Giving a hint to the behaviour of the button upon activation, this is also known as an affordance. Could the non-visual UX be improved by providing a comparable affordance for the button behaviour?<p>

            <p><strong>Consider every element and document any desired UX improvements.

Also document <a href="#states">states</a> for relevant actionable elements, changes to <a href="#language">language</a> and any <a href="#additional-functionality">additional functionality</a> that would improve the UX.</strong> In our example, for the share buttons, we’ll provide context with a hint. We can also improve the UX with additional list semantics as the share buttons form a collection of related items. The combined announcement of content, semantic roles and hint for the first share button will now be ‘Facebook. Button. Share this article. 1 of 5’.</p>

                <p>Standard UI elements may include some default UX improvements. It is always still important to document. Not sure what the default UX improvements are for a UI element, ask an engineer for an example on the relevant platforms. If you can improve the user experience then do so. Keep in mind that standard UI elements are used widely across the app ecosystem and users will thank you for consistency.</p>

            <p>All actionable elements, such as links and buttons, are by default focusable with a screen reader and other assistive technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access">switch devices</a>. The order in which these elements can be focused and interacted with, for example with a keyboard by pressing the ‘TAB’ key, is important to consider. This order is referred to as the focus order or sometimes the tab order. All focusable elements should be visually displayed when they receive focus, and this order should follow a logical sequence. This is usually expected visually from left to right as you move through elements and down a screen. Though there will be some exceptions to this. This order is by default defined by the content order.</p>

            <p><strong>Define the focus order by adding a directional line between actionable elements. Also document when focus needs to be moved on the users behalf after an in-screen interaction</strong>. In our example, in addition to defining the focus order, we’ll also add some notes on focus movement for the 'Close' button upon activation.</p>

            <details class="details">
                <summary>Moving focus on the users behalf</summary>
            
                <p>It’s important to consider when focus needs to be moved on the users behalf after an in-screen interaction. Interactions should follow a logical sequence and provide a good user experience. For example, if a ‘Show more updates’ button is activated and new content is inserted above the button, by default focus would remain on the button after activation, this would be a frustrating experience for assistive technology users, who would then have to identify the start of the new content and navigate to it. In this example, to improve the UX, focus should be moved on the users behalf to the new content upon activation of the button.</p>

            <h3 id="step-9-define-any-containers" class="h3" tabindex="-1">Step 9 - Define any containers</h3>

            <p>Typically we use colour or other styling to identify areas of screens or pages visually. On the web for example, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News</a> website has a red block at the top. Visually this groups and identifies the page banner content. In the non-visual experience, you need another way to do this for both the web and native apps.</p>

            <p>Landmarks provide a way for screen readers to identify areas of web pages, containers are the equivalent in a natvie app. This enables users to identify and navigate to areas of a screen. Note navigation is not currently possible via containers with Talkback on Android.</p>

            <p>Note, landmarks and containers are different to headings. Use the ‘show landmarks’ and ‘show headings’ buttons at the top of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html">ARIA landmarks examples</a> page to see how. The same principles apply for containers to that of landmarks, which are the native app equivalent.</p>

            <p><strong>If appropriate document any containers and associated labels for your component. Also make a note of any containers your component should sit within if relevant</strong>. For web content there are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/banner.html">8 landmark roles</a> that you can use. Think along similar lines for a native app. Use the steps in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html">General Principles of Landmark Design</a> to decide if a container is appropriate for your component and/or part of it. This won't always be necessary. In our example, we’ll add a fictional region landmark.</p>

            <p>Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible user experience on the web. When HTML is viewed in the browser without styling, this is the ‘no CSS’ experience, and this can be presented to users at times; in which case core content should be accessible and readable.</p>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature with no CSS, using a browser setting or third party tool.</p>

            <p>Viewing the ‘no CSS’ experience is one of the practices that helps us meet the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/mobile/">BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines</a> and recommendations in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/html/">BBC Guide to Accessible HTML Documents</a>, specifically:</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/mobile/styling-and-readability">Styling and readability guideline</a></li>

            </ul>

            <p>Don’t leave it to chance:</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Technology</strong> - The no CSS experience provides a baseline core experience, dependent on minimum technology. By it’s nature this offers multiple ways for users to consume content. It allows users to choose software and use devices that work best for them, in a broad range of situations and circumstances.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Foundation</strong> - The no CSS experience is the foundation upon which accessible user experiences are enhanced (with CSS and JavaScript).</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Suporting users</strong> - A good no CSS user experience supports users who change styling settings (to adapt the appearance of pages). For example by using a custom style sheet, to suit specific user needs for reading content and using web pages.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Chance</strong> - A no CSS experience gives our content more chance of being consumed. For example if viewing on an older device or browser, with limited support, robust content that minimises dependencies is more likely to succeed. "The minimum dependency for a web site should be an internet connection and the ability to parse HTML." (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/html/progressive-enhancement">Progressive enhancement guide</a>)</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Access</strong> - No CSS might not always be the users choice. When it isn’t we want to give users the best chance of accessing news, and for the experience to be as good as it can be. For example, in disaster scenarios, when data maybe scace, it’s imperative to be able to access news if needed.</li>

            <h2 id="what-is-core-content" class="h2" tabindex="-1">What is core content?</h2>

            <p>Core content are the elements that fulfill the core purpose of a page. For example, the core content of a news article page, are the elements that form the story itself. The onwards jouneys on a news article page are not core content, though the accessibility of non-core page elements still matters.</p>

            <details class="details">
                <summary>Other examples of core content</summary>

                 <p><strong>Live pages</strong> - A ‘Live’ page has a core purpose to provide the newest information about an event to the users. The core content includes the newest information at the time of a page request. The experience is enhanced when JavaScript automatically updates this content without a user having to take action. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/html/progressive-enhancement">Progressive enhancement guide</a>)</p>

                 <p><strong>Media pages</strong> - If the primary content of a page is dynamic with additional dependencies, such as a video or game, then the core purpose could be to provide a context from which to launch that content... This might include information on the technology dependency required and links to alternative content. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/html/progressive-enhancement">Progressive enhancement guide</a>)</p>

            <h2 id="how-to-turn-css-off" class="h2" tabindex="-1">How to turn CSS off</h2>

            <p>Some browsers have built in settings which enable you to easily turn off / disable CSS. With browsers that don’t offer these settings, you can use a third party tool.</p>

            <p class="no-space"><strong>Firefox</strong></p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Built in setting: Go to the toolbar and choose: 'View', then 'Page Style', then 'No Style'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">Third party tool: Open <a href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer browser extension</a> and choose: 'CSS', then 'Disable All Styles'. Note, this tool does not disable styles in <a href="#shadow-dom-content">shadow DOM content</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="no-space"><strong>Chrome</strong></p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Third party tool: Open <a href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer browser extension</a> and choose: 'CSS', then 'Disable All Styles'. Note, this tool does not disable styles in <a href="#shadow-dom-content">shadow DOM content</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="no-space"><strong>Safari</strong></p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Built in setting: Go to the toolbar, if you don't see 'Develop',  go to 'Settings' in the 'Safari' menu, then 'Advanced', then check 'Show features for web developers'. You should now see 'Develop' in the toolbar, from here choose 'Show Web Inspector'. Within the Web Inspector toolbar choose: 'Device Settings', then 'Core Features', then 'Disable CSS'.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note, this guide takes one approach, there are other ways you could do this, such as by directly removing CSS via a web inspector browser tool.</p>

            <h2 id="which browser-tool" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Which browser / tool should you use?</h2>

            <ul class="body-copy-list" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Product</strong> - Take into account your product <b>browser stats</b>, and also <b>no css and accessiblity features offered by a browser</b>. For example, your product may have the most users in one browser, if that browser has no or limited, no css and accessibility features built in, you may wish to also check no css in a browser that offers wider built in no css and accessiblity settings to users.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>The code</strong> - Also, take into account the way the page you are viewing is constructed in the DOM, for example if it contains <a href="#shadow-dom-content">shadow DOM content</a>.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Browser setting</strong> - If a built a browser setting is available, use this over a third party tool.</li>

                <summary id="shadow-dom-content">Shadow DOM content</summary>

                 <p>Shadow DOM content is encapsulated, this means it contains it’s own CSS seperate from the main page. CSS for this type of content may not ‘turn off’ with all browser settings / tools. This could be dependent on a number of factors, for example, the way the browser / tool was designed, page load speeds or component loading methods; such as if the component is loaded by a user action.</p>

                <p>Encapsulated content is typically content that remains meaningful when separated from the main content, perphas of a more complex nature, supplied by a different team or third party, such as a media player, map or graphical visualisation.</p>

Inorder for the logo to be seen on a white background when there is no CSS, it needs to use a perceivable colour, such as black. This is especially important for icons that provide meaning. Note, colours cannot be changed with some image formats, such as jpeg, png or gif, use SVGs if possible. Also note that this maybe more difficut to acheive if SVG’s use more than one colour.</li>

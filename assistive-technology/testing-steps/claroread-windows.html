            <p>To test with ClaroRead, use the 'ClaroRead Chrome' web extension, this enables ClaroRead to work well when reading web content in Chrome. This is not installed by default.</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">To check if you have the 'ClaroRead Chrome' extension already installed on your device, in Chrome <b>go to 'Settings', then under 'Extensions', look for 'ClaroRead Chrome'</b>, you should see the extension, make sure it's turned on.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you can't see the extension, download 'ClaroRead Chrome' from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>. After download, check the extension is turned on, go to 'Settings', then 'Extensions'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">To start using ClaroRead, in the <b>extensions menu</b> (to the right of the address bar), <b>click 'ClaroRead Chrome'</b>. When ClaroRead is open, the ClaroRead <b>toolbar will be displayed on screen</b>.</li>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to test with <b>content in a language that you can understand</b> and with <b>a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology. For further information see the <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/assistive-technology/assistive-technology-testing-in-a-foreign-language.html">assistive technology testing in a foreign language guide</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.clarosoftware.com/support/voices/">ClaroRead supports 30 languages</a>, to select a foreign language voice:</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">In the ClaroRead toolbar, go to 'Settings'.</li>
                <li role="listitem">Under 'Speech' select a foreign language voice that matches that of the content you are testing.</li>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques. The steps also <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use ClaroRead for the first time</b>.</p>

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>As you go, <b>make notes</b> of any <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/accessibility-bugs.html">bugs</a> you find.</p>

            <p>Promo's usually have a large clickable area, this can sometimes make selecting content to read aloud difficult. Check the content can be read aloud using both of the following methods:</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><b>Hover to read</b>: In the toolbar, go to 'Setting', then under 'Speech', check 'Speak under mouse' is selected. Now hover the mouse cursor over the promo content and hear it read aloud. Check all content is read aloud, such as <b>links, text and images</b>. Note, if the promo is comprised of more elements than a text link, such as an image or timestamp, <b>if the link text is the only content to be read aloud</b>, this is likely due to the way that the code that is used to create the large clickable area works. This is acceptable when hovering to read, for this type of content, as this tool is primarily used for reading long form content e.g. paragraphs of text.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><b>Click and read</b>: Click the mouse cursor just before the component starts, then click the ‘Play’ button in the toolbar to hear it read aloud. ClaroRead will carry on reading until you click the ‘Stop’ button in the toolbar. Check all content is read aloud, such as <b>links, text and images</b>.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Voice Control for iOS comes already installed on iPhones. It's recommended to <b>use a shortcut</b> to turn Voice Control on or off.</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Go to ‘Settings’, then within the ‘Accessibility’ menu look for ‘Accessibility Shortcut’, make sure Voice Control is selected here. This shortcut will enable you to toggle Voice Control on or off, from any screen or web page, at any time.</li>

                <li role="listitem">With the Voice Control shortcut enabled, on newer iPhones, you will now be able to <b>triple click the side button to toggle Voice Control on or off at any time</b>. With older style iPhones the shortcut is a triple click of the ‘home’ button.</li>

                <li role="listitem">When Voice Control is on and ready to use, <b>a microphone will be displayed in the status bar</b> at the top of the screen. If using Voice Control for the first time a required file will be downloaded automatically.</li>

                <li role="listitem">You can tell Voice Control not to listen by saying '<b>Go to sleep</b>', say '<b>Wake up</b>' to toggle listening back on. The microphone in the status bar indicates if Voice Control is listening or not.</li>
                
                <li role="listitem">When Voice Control is on and listening, <b>you can speak commands just like you would perform an action by touch</b>. For example, you can say 'Swipe down' or 'Swipe up' to scroll a web page.</li>
                
                <li role="listitem">To see a list of voice commands, go to the ‘Accessibility’ menu in ‘Settings’, then under the 'Voice Control' menu read 'Learn more' at the top. There are many <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210417">Voice Control commands</a> that you can use, though only a few are needed to perform the testing steps, all of which are explained below.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you find Voice Control is <b>having difficulty understanding your voice commands</b>, try speaking slower and as clearly as possible. Also make sure there is no background noise, to reduce this, you could use headphones with a microphone.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="testing-in-a-foreign-language" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Testing in a foreign language</h2>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to test with <b>content in a language that you can understand</b> and with <b>a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology. For further information see the <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/assistive-technology/assistive-technology-testing-in-a-foreign-language.html">assistive technology testing in a foreign language guide</a>.</p>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques. The steps also <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use Voice Control for the first time</b>.</p>

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>As you go, <b>make notes</b> of any <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/accessibility-bugs.html">bugs</a> you find.</p>

            <p>You are now ready to start testing.</p>

            <p>All actionable elements, such as links, buttons and form elements, should be able to be used with a voice command. Go through each actionable element in turn:</p>

                <li role="listitem">If the element has some <b>visible text</b>, say 'Tap' followed by the text you can see.

                <li role="listitem">If the element has <b>no visible text</b>, a visual affordance for the element should provide a clue to the name of the element. For example, if the element only has an icon, such as a menu icon, try saying 'Tap menu'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you are still unable to activate the element, say '<b>Show grid</b>', a numbered grid will now be displayed over the page. Locate the grid number where you would tap to activate the element, then say 'Tap' plus the grid number, for example 'Tap 3'. The central area of the grid square is used as the tap point, this needs to be over the element, if it is not, say the grid number, for example '3', you will then be presented with a smaller grid to select from. To hide the grid, say '<b>Hide grid</b>'</li>

                <li role="listitem">Go through all actionable elements in the component including those within expandable or popup content, activating each element in turn, until you reach the end of the component you're testing.</li>

            <p>In addition, if the component has a <b>large scrollable or swipeable area</b>, when in view ensure that this area does not interfere with the ability to view content above or below the area. For example, if a scrollable map fills the majority of the viewport, when this is in view can you navigate to the content below this with a voice command? With the large scrollable or swipeable area in view, say 'Swipe up' and 'Swipe down' checking that you can view content above and below any such areas in the component.</p>

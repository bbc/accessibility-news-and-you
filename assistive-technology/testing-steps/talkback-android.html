            <h2 id="how-to-turn-talkback-on-off" class="h2" tabindex="-1">How to turn TalkBack on / off</h2>

            <p>TalkBack screen reader for Android comes <b>already installed on some devices</b>. To check if you have TalkBack already installed, go to 'Settings', within the 'Accessibility' menu you should see TalkBack. If you can't see TalkBack, go to the Google Play store and download the 'Android Accessibility Suite', this includes TalkBack.</p> 

            <p>It's recommended to use the <b>volume key shortcut</b> to turn TalkBack on or off. Go to ‘Settings’, then within the ‘Accessibility’ menu look for TalkBack, make sure the volume key shortcut is enabled here for TalkBack. If you can't see the shortcut here, you might find this directly within the ‘Accessibility’ menu or within 'Advanced settings' from the ‘Accessibility’ menu. Once enabled, this shortcut will give you the ability to toggle TalkBack on or off, from any screen or web page, at any time. Note, some devices may not offer this shortcut, in this case choose from one of the other <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100?hl=en&ref_topic=10601570">options for turning TalkBack on or off</a>.</p>

            <p>With the volume key shortcut enabled, you will now be able to <b>press and hold both volume keys for three seconds to toggle TalkBack on or off at any time</b>.</p>

            <p>If at any time you would like to <b>stop TalkBack while announcing something</b>, do a two-finger tap anywhere on the screen. To <b>activate an item</b>, once it has focus, do a single-finger double tap anywhere on the screen. There are many <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827">TalkBack gestures</a> that you can use, though only a few are needed to perform the testing steps, all of which are explained below.</p>

            <h2 id="its-speaking-too-fast" class="h2" tabindex="-1">It's speaking too fast</h2>

            <p>If you are new to TalkBack, you may find the rate in which announcements are made too quick to understand. To find a speech rate that you are comfortable with:</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Select ‘<b>Speech rate</b>’ in the <b>Reading controls</b> menu by swiping up then down until you hear ‘Speech rate’ announced. <a href="#gesture-doesnt-work">Gesture doesn't work?</a></li>

                <li role="listitem">The speech rate can now be adjusted by swiping up or down</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe down to decrease the speech rate</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe up to increase the speech rate</li>

            <h2 id="testing-in-a-foreign-language" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Testing in a foreign language</h2>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to <b>test in a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology, and with a <b>language that you can understand</b>. For further information see the <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/assistive-technology/assistive-technology-testing-in-a-foreign-language.html">assistive technology testing in a foreign language guide</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006983">TalkBack language support varies by device</a>, check what languages are supported on your device.</p>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques. The steps also <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use TalkBack for the first time</b>.</p>

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>As you go, <b>make notes</b> of any <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/accessibility-bugs.html">bugs</a> you find.</p>

                <li role="listitem">To check if you have Voice Access already installed, go to 'Settings', within the 'Accessibility' menu you should see Voice Access.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you can't see Voice Access, go to the Google Play store and download 'Voice Access' by Google. When the download is complete you will be prompted to open and set up Voice Access, follow the set up steps.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><b>To turn Voice Access on or off</b>, go to 'Settings', then within the 'Accessibility' menu look for 'Voice Access', here you can turn Voice Access on or off.

                <li role="listitem">Once on, to use voice commands <b>you need to tell Voice Access to listen</b>. You can toggle listening on or off, from any screen or web page, at any time. In notifications, under Voice Access, look for 'Tap to start' to toggle listening on, or 'Tap to pause' to toggle listening off. <b>When Voice Access is listening, a listening icon will be displayed at the top of the screen</b>. If you can't see the icon, try saying a command to help you locate it, such as 'Scroll down'. If you still can't see the listening icon, go to the home screen and tap the 'Voice Access' icon, then try again to locate the listening icon.</li>

                <li role="listitem">When Voice Access is on and listening, <b>you can speak commands just like you would perform an action by touch</b>. For example, you can say 'Swipe down' or 'Swipe up' to scroll a web page.</li>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to test with <b>content in a language that you can understand</b> and with <b>a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology. For further information see the <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/assistive-technology/assistive-technology-testing-in-a-foreign-language.html">assistive technology testing in a foreign language guide</a>.</p>

            <p>You can speak Voice Access commands in English, Spanish, German, Italian, or French.</p>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques. The steps also <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use Voice Access for the first time</b>.</p>

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>You are now ready to start testing.</p>

            <p>All actionable elements, such as links, buttons and form elements, should be able to be used with a voice command. Go through each actionable element in turn:</p>

                <li role="listitem">If the element has some <b>visible text</b>, say 'Tap' followed by the text you can see. For example, to activate a link with text of 'Powerful earthquake hits coast' say '<b>Tap Powerful earthquake hits coast</b>' or you can just say the first few words, such as 'Tap Powerful earthquake'. If there is more than one link on screen with the same text you will now be presented with a number for each element, say the number of the element you wish to activate, such as '2'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If the element has <b>no visible text</b>, a visual affordance for the element should provide a clue to the name of the element. For example, if the element only has an icon, such as a menu icon, try saying 'Tap menu'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you are unable to activate the element by the above methods, say '<b>Show numbers</b>' or '<b>Show labels</b>', you will now be presented with a number or label for each element. Say 'Tap' followed by the displayed number or label for the element, such as '<b>Tap 5</b>' or 'Tap Settings'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you are still unable to activate the element, say '<b>Show grid</b>', a numbered grid will now be displayed over the page. Locate the grid number where you would tap to activate the element, then say 'Tap' plus the grid number, for example 'Tap 3'. The central area of the grid square is used as the tap point, this needs to be over the element, if it is not, say the grid number, for example '3', you will then be presented with a smaller grid to select from. To hide the grid, say '<b>Hide grid</b>'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">Go through all actionable elements in the component including those within expandable or popup content, activating each element in turn, until you reach the end of the component you're testing.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After activating a link, <b>to go back</b> to the component you're testing, say 'Tap back' or 'Go back'.</p>

            <p>If the component has a <b>horizontal scrollable area</b>, or a <b>horizontal swipeable area such as a carousel</b>, ensure you can view all the content in this area.</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">

            <p>In addition, if the component has a <b>large scrollable or swipeable area</b>, when in view ensure that this area does not interfere with the ability to view content above or below the area. For example, if a scrollable map fills the majority of the viewport, when this is in view can you navigate to the content below this with a voice command? With the large scrollable or swipeable area in view, say 'Swipe up' and 'Swipe down' checking that you can view content above and below any such areas in the component.</p>

            <p>Dragon is <b>not installed on Windows devices by default</b>.</p>

                <li role="listitem">To check if you have Dragon already installed on your device, <b>go to the taskbar and search for 'Dragon'</b>, you should see the Dragon app listed in the search results, here you can open Dragon.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you can't see Dragon, request this from IT. After download, when opening the app for the first time, follow the set up steps.</li>

                <li role="listitem">When Dragon is open, <b>the Dragon Bar will be displayed on screen</b>, usually at the top in the middle.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><b>Check your user profile is being used</b>. It's important to always use your own user profile, this enables the software to work well for you, with your accent and voice. You maybe prompted to select a user profile when opening Dragon, if not in the Dragon Bar, <b>go to 'Settings', then under 'Profile', select 'Open user profile'</b>. If you've just followed the set up steps, your user profile will have been created and can be selected in the 'Open user profile' window.</li>

                <li role="listitem">Before you can use voice commands you need to <b>switch the microphone on</b>, this allows Dragon to listen. In the Dragon Bar, look for the microphone button.</li>

                <li role="listitem">With the microphone on, you can toggle listening on or off, at any time. <b>Say 'Go to sleep' to toggle listening off</b>. When Dragon is asleep and not listening, the microphone button will be displayed blue with a night icon. Say <b>'Wake up' to toggle listening on</b>. When Dragon is awake and listening, the microphone button will be displayed green with a listening affordance.</li>

                <li role="listitem">When Dragon is listening, <b>you can speak commands just like you would perform an action by mouse</b>. For example, you can say 'Scroll down' or 'Scroll up' to scroll a web page.</li>

                <li role="listitem">To see a list of voice commands, say 'What can I say'. For web specific commands see <a href="https://www.nuance.com/products/help/dragon/dragon-for-pc/enx/professionalgroup/main/Content/Web/web_basics.htm">web browser basics</a> and <a href="https://www.nuance.com/products/help/dragon/dragon-for-pc/enx/professionalgroup/main/Content/Web/working_with_chrome.htm">working with Chrome</a>.

                <li role="listitem">If using Dragon for the first time, follow the interactive tutorial, say 'Open tutorial'.</li>

                <li role="listitem">To exit and close Dragon, in the Dragon Bar, go to 'Tools', then select 'Exit Dragon'. Alternatively, you can right click the 'Dragon' app in the taskbar, then click the close icon.</li>

                <li role="listitem">If you find Dragon is <b>having difficulty understanding your voice commands</b>, try speaking slower and as clearly as possible. Also make sure there is no background noise, to reduce this, you could use headphones with a microphone.</li>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to test with <b>content in a language that you can understand</b> and with <b>a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology.

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques.

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

                <li role="listitem">If you are still unable to activate the element, say '<b>Mouse grid</b>', a numbered grid will now be displayed over the page.

You will then be presented with a smaller grid to select from. <b>Keep saying the grid number until the grid is a similar size to the element</b>, the mouse cursor will change to a hand pointer,  you can then say '<b>Mouse click</b>' to click the element.

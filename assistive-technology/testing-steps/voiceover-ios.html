            <h2 id="how-to-turn-voiceover-on-off" class="h2" tabindex="-1">How to turn VoiceOver on / off</h2>

            <p>VoiceOver screen reader for iOS comes already installed on iPhones. It's recommended to use a <b>shortcut</b> to turn VoiceOver on or off. Go to ‘Settings’, then within the ‘Accessibility’ menu look for ‘Accessibility Shortcut’, make sure VoiceOver is selected here. This shortcut will enable you to toggle VoiceOver on or off, from any screen or web page, at any time.</p>

            <p>With the VoiceOver shortcut enabled, on newer iPhones, you will now be able to <b>triple click the side button to toggle VoiceOver on or off at any time</b>. With older style iPhones the shortcut is a triple click of the ‘home’ button.</p>

            <p>If at any time you would like to <b>stop VoiceOver while announcing something</b>, do a two-finger tap anywhere on the screen. To <b>activate an item</b>, once it has focus, double tap anywhere on the screen. There are many <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e2281/ios">VoiceOver gestures</a> that you can use, though only a few are needed to perform the testing steps, all of which are explained below.</p>

            <h2 id="its-speaking-too-fast" class="h2" tabindex="-1">It's speaking too fast</h2>

            <p>If you are new to VoiceOver, you may find the rate in which announcements are made too quick to understand. To find a speaking rate that you are comfortable with:</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Select ‘<b>Speaking rate</b>’ in the <b>Rotor</b> menu by doing a two-finger rotation gesture (similar to how you might turn a dial with your thumb and finger) until you hear ‘Speaking rate’ announced</li>

                <li role="listitem">The speaking rate can now be adjusted by swiping up or down</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe down to decrease the speaking rate</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe up to increase the speaking rate</li>

            <h2 id="testing-in-a-foreign-language" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Testing in a foreign language</h2>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to <b>test in a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology, and with a <b>language that you can understand</b>. For further information see the assistive technology testing in a foreign language guide.</p>

            <p>Check what <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206175">languages are supported by VoiceOver</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="testing-steps" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Testing steps</h2>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques. The steps also <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use VoiceOver for the first time</b>.</p>

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>As you go, <b>make notes</b> of any <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/accessibility-bugs.html">bugs</a> you find.</p>

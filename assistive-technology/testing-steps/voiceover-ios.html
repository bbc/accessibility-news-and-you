            <h2 id="how-to-turn-on-voiceover" class="h2" tabindex="-1">How to turn on VoiceOver</h2>

            <p>You will find VoiceOver under the ‘Accessibility’ menu in ‘Settings’. Here you can toggle VoiceOver on. Though you are likely to find it <b>more convenient to turn VoiceOver on via an accessibility shortcut</b>. This shortcut enables you to turn VoiceOver on from any screen or web page without going to the ‘Settings’ menu.</p>

            <p>If you are just starting out, navigating using VoiceOver from within the ‘Settings’ menu to the component you are testing, could be a daunting process. Make sure VoiceOver is selected under ‘Accessibility Shortcut’ within the ‘Accessibility’ menu. On newer iPhones, you will now be able to <b>triple click the side button to toggle VoiceOver on or off at any time</b>. With older style iPhones the shortcut is a triple click of the ‘home’ button.</p>

            <p>If at any time you would like to <b>stop VoiceOver while announcing</b>, do a two-finger tap.</p>

            <h2 id="its-speaking-too-fast" class="h2" tabindex="-1">It's speaking too fast</h2>

            <p>If you are new to VoiceOver, you may find the rate in which announcements are made too quick to understand. To find a speaking rate that you are comfortable with:</p>

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Select ‘<b>Speaking rate</b>’ in the <b>Rotor</b> menu by doing a two-finger rotation gesture (similar to how you might turn a dial with your thumb and finger) until you hear ‘Speaking rate’ announced</li>

                <li role="listitem">The speaking rate can now be adjusted by swiping up or down</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe down to decrease the speaking rate</li>

                <li role="listitem">Swipe up to increase the speaking rate</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="testing-in-a-foreign-language" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Testing in a foreign language</h2>

            <p>When testing with assistive technology it's important to <b>test in a language that is supported</b> by the assistive technology, and with a <b>language that you can understand</b>. For further information see the testing in a foreign language guide.</p>

            <p>Before testing content in a foreign language, check what <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206175">languages are supported by VoiceOver</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="step-by-step" class="h2" tabindex="-1">Step by step</h2>

            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. Following the same steps every time, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques.</p>

            <p>There are many <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e2281/ios">VoiceOver gestures</a> that you can use, though only a few are needed to perform the testing steps, all of which are explained below. The steps will <b>enable anyone, in any role, to use VoiceOver for the first time</b>. To become more familiar and proficient using AT, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

            <p>As you go, make a note of any <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/accessibility-bugs.html">bugs</a> you find.</p>

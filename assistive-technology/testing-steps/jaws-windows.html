            <p>We’ll take you step by step through how to test a component or feature. <b>Following the same steps every time</b>, ensures that everyone is testing using the same methods and using the most common techniques.

            <p>To become more familiar and proficient using assistive technology, resist the temptation to cheat, always try to navigate like a user would.</p>

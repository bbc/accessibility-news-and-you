## What should I test?
0. Test the feature using magnification
1. Test the feature using magnification and the App Reader 

## Testing steps

The accessibility acceptance criteria can be used for additional manual testing steps on device, this is written by the [Business Analyst](accessibility-news-and-business-analysts) and part of their checklist. 

0. Open ZoomText
1. If speech is on, turn this off (ALT + SHIFT + S)
2. Ensure the **magnification power** is atleast 2x. Display the User Interface if this is not shown (ALT + INSERT). Select the 'Magnifier' tab, under 'Zoom Window' use the up and down interface arrows to change the magnification power.
3. Select a **Window Type** (CTRL + SHIFT + Z) and move the cursor around the window/feature in Internet Explorer. Can you easily use and understand the feature? Are you having to scroll large distances for associated content/controls, for example, is the submit button along way from the search input field?
3. Bring up the user interface (ALT + INSERT) and change the magnification power to 1, then select each of the different '**Colour**' schemes in turn, is the feature always fully visible? Can you still see the hover and focus styling?
5. Does the feature have edit fields, such as a search input? If so, bring up the user interface (ALT + INSERT), then select each of the different '**Cursor**' schemes in turn. Is the cursor enhancement always fully visible in the edit fields?
6. Enable Speech on the Reader (ALT + SHIFT + S). Bring up the user interface (ALT + INSERT), then select each of the different '**Focus**' schemes in turn. Use the tab key on the keyboard to tab through the feature in Internet Explorer (To tab backwards, use SHIFT + TAB). Is your position always indicated on the page? Is the focus ouline clear? Does the focus outline sit on top of text or look irregular? Is content read out correctly? Is any content read out more than once?
7. Bring up the user interface (ALT + INSERT) and start '**AppRdr**' under the 'Reading' tab. Select Internet Explorer and use the mouse to click just before the feature you are testing, it will then start reading, let it read through the feature to the start of the next feature. Is the content read out in a logical order following the visual order? Is content read out correctly? Is any content read out more than once?

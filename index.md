## What is A11y?
Accessiblity is often referred to as 'A11y' for short. Not really sure what accessibility is or why we should consider it? 

"**The most powerful technology in the world is technology that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use. To work, create, communicate, stay in shape, and be entertained. So we don’t design products for some people or even most people. We design them for every single person.**" (Apple)

"**When I turn on a game like "Uncharted", I'm not, you know confined to a wheelchair, I'm a swashbuckler, there to treasure-hunt, like Nathan Drake. That brief period of escape is why accessibility is so crucial.**" (Josh Straub)

Watch the following two short videos for a quick introduction on accessibility.

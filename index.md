## What is A11y?

Accessibility is often referred to as 'A11y' for short. It refers to the "ability to access" a given web page or service, usually in the context of design for people with disabilities.

## Not really sure what accessibility is or why we should consider it?

"**The most powerful technology in the world is technology that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use. To work, create, communicate, stay in shape, and be entertained. So we don’t design products for some people or even most people. We design them for every single person.**" (Apple)

"**When I turn on a game like "Uncharted", I'm not, you know confined to a wheelchair, I'm a swashbuckler, there to treasure-hunt, like Nathan Drake. That brief period of escape is why accessibility is so crucial.**" (Josh Straub)

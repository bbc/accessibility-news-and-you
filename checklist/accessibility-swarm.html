            <h2 id="2-screen-reader-ux" class="h3" tabindex="-1">2) Screen reader UX</h2>

            <p>Accessible design process includes documenting the user experience (UX) for screen reader users. This also helps in achieving a good UX for other types of assistive technology users.</p>

            <p><b>Review the screen reader UX by inspecting the code</b>. Note, this check should be carried out by a designer (as they are responsible for the user experience) alongside an engineer.</p>

            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Open the documented screen reader UX to review against.</li>
                <li role="listitem">In a web browser, inspect the code for the component or feature. Not sure how, ask an engineer to show you.</li>
                <li role="listitem">Check that the code matches what is documented in the screen reader UX. Within the  HTML you might see a number of additional div or span elements, these elements are mainly used to achieve layout and visual styling with CSS. By default, no semantics will be announced from either div or span elements.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Note, reviewing the screen reader UX by inspecting the code, is one step in the review process. This should never replace reviewing the user experience with <a href="#15-test-with-assistive-technology">a range of screen readers and other assistive technologies</a>.</p>

            <p>For more information see the guide <a href="https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/screen-reader-ux.html">how to document the screen reader user experience</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="3-visual-affordance" class="h3" tabindex="-1">3) Visual affordance</h2>

            <p>Affordances or visual clues are used to communicate meaning and expectations, such as those that help users understand what will happen when they perform an action. Always use a consistent approach.</p>

            <p><b>Review all visual affordances</b>, such as:</p>
            
            <ol class="body-copy-list ordered-list-steps" role="list">
                <li role="listitem">Does an elements visual styling communicate the correct <b>meaning</b>? For example, do headings look like headings?</li>
                <li role="listitem">Does an elements visual styling communicate the correct <b>expectations</b>? For example, do links look like links?</li>
                <li role="listitem">Does any dynamic content or in-page interactions provide hints to their <b>behaviour</b>? For example, a 'More' button with a downwards arrow helps users understand upon activation, associated content will expand downwards.</li>
                <li role="listitem">Is the visual styling of an element <b>consistent</b> with that in other components or features?</li>
                <li role="listitem">Do interactive elements have consistent <b>hover and focus styling</b>?</li>
            </ol>

            <details class="details">
                <summary>More on visual affordance</summary>

                 <p>Visual styling should communicate the semantic meaning of HTML elements. For example, interactive elements should look like interactive elements. If you don't have perceived affordance this may cause issues for some users. For example, those using speech recognition assistive technology, rely on being able to visually interpret meaning and behaviour to know what they can interact with and how, via speech.</p>

                 <p>In a well designed visual user experience, a sighted user should be able to identify elements and their semantic roles along with any expected behaviours by simply looking at them. For example, when viewing an article, you can usually identify text that has a semantic role of heading because the font size of it is larger than that of surrounding text.</p>

            <p>Good colour contrast enables more people to consume our content. Colours should meet a contrast ratio of <b>4.5:1 or higher</b>, this includes stand-alone graphical objects (with no associated text) that have meaning.</p>

            <p>Colour blindness is a vision deficiency. You see colours differently to most people. You may find it hard to tell the difference between colours or you may have no colour perception at all.</p>

            <p>It's possible to emulate vision colour deficiency with a browser tool. Use either <a href="#colour-blindness-chrome-steps">Chrome</a> or <a href="#colour-blindness-firefox-steps">Firefox</a> to perform this check.</p>    

            <ul class="body-copy-list no-space" role="list">

                <li>Are all core elements in the feature perceivable?</li>
                <li>Check that no meaning or information is lost (when colours can't be distingusihed).</li>
                <li>For example, in each emulation, with sight only, can you distingusih link text from non-linking text? And are the associated affordances for hover and focus perceivable?</li>

            <p>Good heading structure enables more people to consume our content. This is particularly important to users of assistive technology, such as a screen reader, for which headings and good heading structure is essential to navigating and understanding web pages and content.</p>

            <p>View the component or feature in the browser, <a href="#how-to-view-the-heading-structure">view the heading structure</a> and check the following:</p>
            
            <ul class="body-copy-list" role="list">
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Logical</strong> - Is the heading structure logical, does it make sense? Headings should represent sections and subsections of content.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Levels</strong> - Check each heading level 2 (H2) is a subheading of a heading level 1 (H1), and that each heading level 3 (H3) a subheading of a heading level (H2), and so forth.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Missing</strong> - Are any heading levels missing or skipped? If viewing a component or feature in isolation, you may not have all heading levels. Headings should however, always be sequential and hierarchical, if they aren't this can cause confusion for a screen reader user; and make it harder to navigate and find content.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Heading level 1</strong> - Check there is <b>no more than one heading level 1</b> (H1). Pages should have only one primary subject, while the HTML standard permits more than one heading level 1, this is not supported with assistive technology such as a screen reader.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Main landmark</strong> - Check that the H1 is the first content within the main landmark, this will ensure that screen reader users who navigate via headings don’t miss content.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Related content</strong> - Ensure headings are followed by content. A heading should always label a portion of content, they should be followed by either non-heading content such as a paragraph or time element, or the next sequential hierarchical sub-heading. For example, a H3 should not be followed directly by another H3, as it would not be labelling a portion of content.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Presentation</strong> - Check that heading elements are not being used soley to achieve presentation. Heading elements should not be used to make text bold or larger, when there is no semantic meaning of heading for the content.</li>

                <li role="listitem"><strong>Foreign language</strong> - If working with foreign language content, translate heading text and check each heading is an appropriate label for the portion of content which follows it.</li>
                
                <li role="listitem"><strong>Isolation</strong> - If viewing a component or feature in isolation, check if the heading structure is correct for the component or features intended use within a page. Check again that the page will only include one heading level 1.</li>

            <p>Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible user experience on the web. When HTML is viewed in the browser without styling, this is referred to as the ‘no CSS’ experience, and this can be presented to users at times; in which case <b>core content should be accessible and readable</b>.</p>

            <p>The no JS (JavaScript) experience isn't an accessibility concern, though it often gets thrown into this bucket, to ensure this hasn't been forgotten about check it now.</p>

For example, when JavaScript is missing for content such as a video player, which uses JavaScript to play the video, users should instead be presented with information about why the video isn’t available and / or alternative content such as a transcript.</p>
